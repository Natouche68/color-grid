# Color Grid

See all 256 colors that can be rendered by your terminal with just one command.

This is a simple project to allow me to quickly see the colors that can be rendered on the terminal. It was also to test Bun.

You can find a compiled version at `./color-grid`, but **it is only for Linux**.
